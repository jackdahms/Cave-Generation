# Cave-Generation
Study in cave generation using cellular automata

Includes four presets:
- Default, which generates more realistic caves
- Chunky, which generates more jagged, low-res-esque caves
- Third, which generates large caverns with smooth surfaces
- Maze, which generates an (invalid) maze
